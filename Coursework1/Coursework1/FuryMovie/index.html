<!-- Inside of the head, the first thing added was metadata regarding how the
    web page will be viewed, the 'viewport' tag has been employed with
    'width=device-width' to ensure that the User Interface (UI) will be scaled to fit any
    device that is used to view the page. As a result of this all users regardless
    of how they view the website will be have the same User Experience (UE).
    Secondly, a link has been made to 'style.css', using a separate stylesheet
    rather than placing individual styling in-line ensures that the code is
    easier to read; by browsers and developers alike. -->

         <h1 id="FURY"> FURY </h1>

       </header>
      </div>

<!-- An <h1> element has been used for the title of the webpage as this denotes to
   the browser that this should be the most important heading. An 'id' attribute
   has also been added in here for so that a link can be added into the bottom of
    the <footer> in order to be browught back to the top of the webpage. -->

      <div class="container">
         <div class="center">

          <button>  <a href="cast.html">CAST</a> </button>
         </div>
      </div>
   </nav>

<!--  A <nav> element has been used here in order to define what is nested within
  the element, the two buttons hold links to both the 'Home' and 'Cast' pages.
  So, with this the browser and screen readers are aware that what is nested within the element
  should be used for navigating the web page. This makes sure that the page is
  accessible for people who have disibilityes.
  As well as this both 'container and 'center' classes have been added for styling. -->


      <div class="synopsis">
         <h2> SYNOPSIS </h2>
             <p> FURY, tells the gritty story of five men from the US Army’s Armoured
          Division, attempt to put a stop to the Nazi regime as they roll through
               western German countryside.</p>
             <p>In the final days of the Second World War the Allies push the German War
          Machine ever closer towards Berlin, yet the victors of this war still
          hang in the balance with American soldiers on their last fighting legs
          – as the end draws nearer, five unlikely companions from the Second
          Armoured Division push their minds, bodies and their Tank ‘Fury’ to
               their absolute limits.</p>
             <p>‘Wardaddy’ (Brad Pitt) is joined by the likes of ‘Bible’ Swan
          (Shia LaBeouf), Grady Travis (Jon Bernthal) and ‘Gordo’ Garcia
               (Michael Peña) and ‘Red.’</p>
             <p>For them, the war began in Northern Africa, from there: Italy, and then
          to France, but just as their caterpillar tracks cross the French-German
          border, Red is killed. It is now up to newbie: Norman Ellison
          (Logan Lerman), a V-Corps Clerk Typist, thrown into the hands of these
          battle hardened men, to steer Fury and her insatiable crew to victory.
             </p>
      </div>

<!-- The 'synopsis' section of the webpage has been placed into another <div>
in order to tell the browser that this shound be viewed as a seperate section
to that of the header, this breaks up the web page into smaller blocks and allows
screen readers to make better understanding of the page's layout. <p> elements
have been used for the main body of text and <h2> element has been used to tell the
browser that this is the next most important heading after <h1>. -->

      <div>
        <h2>TRAILER</h2>
         <video controls style="max-width:100%" poster="../img/furytrailer.jpg" >
          <source src="../vid/furyTrailer.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
          <source src="../vid/furyTrailer.webm" type="video/webm" />
          <source src="../vid/furyTrailer.ogv" type="video/ogg" />
         </video>
      </div>

<!-- The next <div> element has the <video> tag nested within. Again, this
allows screen readers to know that this shoiuld be seen as a new section within
web page. The 'Controls' attribute provides a full set of playback controls for
the attached video. It has been included to allow the user to chose when the
video plays. This eliminates the possibility of the video automatically playing
when the site loads. The 'style' attribute has also been included: "max-width:100%"
ensures that the video player will not exceed the width of any device it is displayed on.

A poster attribute has also been included so that an image sits on the video
player until it is played. This avoids the first frame of the video being the
default and fits in with what would be expected on other film websites.

Three Sources have been used for the video element. The first one is the '.mp4'
as that is what was wanted as the default, however '.webm' and '.ogg' versions
have both been provided as fallbacks in case the browser does not suppot the
original '.mp4' format. -->

  inside of button elements. This allows for a larger aread to be clicked on which
  makes things more accessible for diables users. An additional buttonhas been used
  for the link to bring the user back to the top of the page.

  A class attribute has also been included that links to the stylesheet for
  additional height on the footer to compensate for the button sizes.
