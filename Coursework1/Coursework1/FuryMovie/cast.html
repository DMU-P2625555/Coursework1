      <h3 id="Brad"> Brad Pitt </h3>
      <img src="../img/pitt.jpeg" alt="Brad_Pitt" class="float-img" />
      <p> William Bradley Pitt (born December 18, 1963) is an American actor and
        film producer. He has received multiple awards, including two Golden
        Globe Awards and an Academy Award for his acting, in addition to another
        Academy Award, another Golden Globe Award and a Primetime Emmy Award as

        <blockquote>
        "I got endless emails at 3am… just a barrage of back story that never
        makes the film but certainly informs the character. When I was talking
        to the veterans, they painted this picture of the exhaustion, the mental
        fatigue, the cold, the hunger, the accumulative effect of seeing trauma
        and horror and inflicting horror on a daily basis. We took that apart
        and began to film."

<!-- Each individual cast member is placed withing a separate <div>, this is
    to provide a clear structure to the browser. They all share the same 'class'
    as that should all be styled the same.

    Image elements have also been used insie of each div. An alt attribute is
    included here so that if there is any issue with the image on the website
    there will still a description of what is intended to be there. Each <img>
    element also has the 'float-img' class so they they can all be styled the same
    from one place on the stylesheet.

    Inside of the <audio> element 'controls' have been given again so thet the
    user can decide when to play the audio, rather than it playing on automatically.
    Two fallback options have also been offered for the <audio> element. The '.wav'
    has been listed first as it is the preferred media, but an '.ogg' and '.mp3'
    have also been provided as a fallback for browsers that wont support the '.wav' format.

    As well as this, there is a fallback in case none of the above media is supported.
    A link has also been provided for an MP3 download in case it is required by the user.
    This ensures there is the same UE across the board for all users.
